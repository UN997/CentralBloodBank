						<br>
						<p>
						The Central Blood Bank is very much aware of how important it is to safeguard your privacy and insure the proper handling of your personal information. Almost all Central Blood Bank web pages can be accessed without giving us any information about yourself. Sometimes though we do require information to provide services that you request, and this privacy statement explains how data is collected and used in those situations. This privacy statement only applies to websites owned by the Central Blood Bank. It does not apply to other online sites, offline sites, sponsors, advertisers, products or services that may appear via links, articles, images and by other means on any Central Blood Bank website.

						We sometimes require your personal information so that we can identify you or contact you if necessary. Typically this is only required when you are using one of our online services like requesting for blood, registring as a donor, looking for nearby blood banks. When you register as a donor then we require your personal information only once when you are creating your account.
